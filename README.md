# MetroBuddy Concept Demo

Trying to create my own AI-powered assistant for Tyne and Wear Metro whilst also using the Vercel AI SDK.

## Setup

- Install: `npm install`
- Run: `npm run dev`
- Env: Add .env.local with GROQ_API_KEY, etc...

## Features (This is just a POC)

- Conversational queries for accurate train times.
- Integrates TransportAPI for realtime data.
